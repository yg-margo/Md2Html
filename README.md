## Markdown to HTML
A converter from Markdown markup to HTML has been developed.
The converter supports the following features:
1. Paragraphs of the text are separated by empty lines.
2. Lowercase markup elements: highlighting (* or _), strong highlighting (** or __), strikethrough (--), code (`)
3. Headers (# * header level)

The converter accepts two arguments: the name of the input file with Markdown markup and the name of the output file with HTML markup. Both files must be UTF-8 encoded.
